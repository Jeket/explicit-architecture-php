    # It might look like overkill to have a connection, instead of the `User` type, because there is only one author,
    # however, this is future proof: If we want to add a feature allowing to have several authors for the same post,
    # the only change will be the amount of authors returned, everything else will stay the same, so there will be
    # no BC breaks, which would happen if we would use the `User` type directly.
